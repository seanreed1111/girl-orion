START WITH
-- A point of view character who needs something
-- An antagonist
-- A call to action

THE PROTAGONIST
        Stella is a nine year old girl.
        Bell is a blue star doll, named after a real star called Bellatrix
    whose choices influence the book most. 
        -- Stella?
        -- Bellatrix

-- Emotional Statement of the Book
    Every book is a thesis on something you believe, this is your thesis statement.

-- Visual Concepts
    Colors, shapes, or images that repeat throughout the book. This should influence the art for the book. 


THE SYNOPSIS
    Come up with a basic synopsis that is 2-6 paragraphs long. The synopsis is not a blurb. You aren't teasing the story or trying to make it interesting. The synopsis is your first rough outline that allows me to ask questions, find problems, and get you on the right path for writing your first draft.

    The first draft won't be a flawless, ready-to-publish book, but it will be there and that's all that matters. A written draft can be edited, the story still stuck in your head can't.  

--What is interesting about this book?
    1. Bell is a talking doll 
    2. Bell is a talking doll that takes Stella out into interstellar space
    3. Bell encloses Stella in a magic shimmering cloud so she can breathe and not get cold while in space
    4. Bell can make Stella grow, and shrink. 
    5. Stella and Bell can get as large as The Earth so she can compare herself in size to the regular sized stars in Orion (companion doubles?)
    5.  Bell can make Stella grow as large as The Sun so she can compare herself in size to the other giant and supergiant stars in Orion
    6.  Bell can make Stella grow to the size of Bellatrix so she can compare herself to the size of Betelgeuse.
    7.  Stars have different colors
    8.  Stars are all huge. Six orders of magnitude between Earth and Betelgeuse.
    9.  Stars are all different sizes from each other, just like people on Earth have different sizes
    10. Stars are not pointy, they are round.
    11. Stars belch out huge ribbons of matter that travel millions of miles away
    12. We are all made of stardust, made from the stuff of stars.
    13. Betelgeuse would extend out past Jupiter and near Saturn if put in the same place as the Sun

    -- Twist 3

    -- Twist 4


-- Goal 1
    What does the character want in the opening sentence?

-- Opening Scene

-- Moment of Despair

-- Climax

-- End Scene
    -- Emotional conclusion that leaves the readers satisfied. Whatever this ending is it should fulfill all the promises you made in the book, and should only be possible because of the things the hero learned.

-- Epilogue
    Stella looked up at Orion on Tuesday night as soon as she got home. Of course it was cloudy Monday and she couldn't see anything! She looked up at the stars and knew she had been right there next to them not long ago. They didn't seem so far away now even though they looked so small again.
