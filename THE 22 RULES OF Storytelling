THE 22 RULES OF
STORYTELLING
AS PER PIXAR
Compiled by Emma Coats , Former Story Artist , Pixar
Animation Studios

YOU ADMIRE A CHARACTER FOR TRYING MORE THAN FOR THEIR SUCCESSES.
#1.
YOU GOTTA KEEP IN MIND WHAT’S INTERESTING TO YOU AS AN AUDIENCE, NOT WHAT’S FUN TO DO AS A WRITER.
THEY CAN BE V. DIFFERENT.

#2.
TRYING FOR THEME IS IMPORTANT,
BUT YOU WON’T SEE WHAT THE
STORY IS ACTUALLY ABOUT
TILL YOU’RE AT THE END OF IT.
NOW REWRITE.
#3.
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS EVERY DAY .....
ONE DAY .....
BECAUSE OF THAT, .....
BECAUSE OF THAT, .....
UNTIL FINALLY ......
___.
#4.
SIMPLIFY. FOCUS. COMBINE CHARACTERS.
HOP OVER DETOURS.
YOU’LL FEEL LIKE YOU’RE
LOSING VALUABLE STUFF
BUT IT SETS YOU FREE.
#5.
WHAT IS YOUR CHARACTER GOOD AT, COMFORTABLE WITH?
THROW THE POLAR OPPOSITE AT THEM.
CHALLENGE THEM. HOW DO THEY DEAL?
#6.
COME UP WITH YOUR ENDING BEFORE YOU FIGURE OUT YOUR MIDDLE.
SERIOUSLY. ENDINGS ARE HARD, GET YOURS WORKING UP FRONT.
#7.
FINISH YOUR STORY, LET GO
EVEN IF IT’S NOT PERFECT.
IN AN IDEAL WORLD YOU HAVE
BOTH, BUT MOVE ON.
DO BETTER NEXT TIME.
#8.
WHEN YOU’RE STUCK, MAKE A LIST OF WHAT WOULDN’T HAPPEN NEXT.
LOTS OF TIMES THE MATERIAL TO GET YOU UNSTUCK WILL SHOW UP.
#9.
PULL APART THE STORIES YOU LIKE. WHAT YOU LIKE IN THEM
IS A PART OF YOU;
YOU’VE GOT TO
RECOGNIZE IT
BEFORE YOU CAN USE IT.
#10.
PUTTING IT ON PAPER LETS YOU
START FIXING IT.
IF IT STAYS IN YOUR HEAD,
A PERFECT IDEA, YOU’LL
NEVER SHARE IT WITH ANYONE.
#11.
DISCOUNT THE 1ST THING THAT COMES TO MIND.
AND THE 2ND, 3RD, 4TH, 5TH
– GET THE OBVIOUS
OUT OF THE WAY.
SURPRISE YOURSELF.
#12.
GIVE YOUR CHARACTERS OPINIONS.
PASSIVE/MALLEABLE MIGHT
SEEM LIKABLE TO YOU
AS YOU WRITE, BUT IT’S
POISON TO THE AUDIENCE.
#13.
WHY MUST YOU TELL THIS STORY?
WHAT’S THE BELIEF
BURNING WITHIN YOU THAT
YOUR STORY FEEDS OFF OF?
THAT’S THE HEART OF IT.
#14.
IF YOU WERE YOUR CHARACTER,
IN THIS SITUATION,
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL?
HONESTY LENDS CREDIBILITY
TO UNBELIEVABLE SITUATIONS.
#15.
WHAT ARE THE STAKES? GIVE US REASON TO ROOT
FOR THE CHARACTER.
WHAT HAPPENS
IF THEY DON’T SUCCEED?
STACK THE ODDS AGAINST.
#16.
NO WORK IS EVER WASTED.
IF IT’S NOT WORKING,
LET GO AND MOVE ON
- IT’LL COME BACK AROUND
TO BE USEFUL LATER.
#17.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOURSELF:
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
DOING YOUR BEST & FUSSING.
STORY IS TESTING,
NOT REFINING.
#18.
COINCIDENCES TO GET CHARACTERS INTO TROUBLE
ARE GREAT;
COINCIDENCES TO GET
THEM OUT OF IT
ARE CHEATING.
#19.
EXERCISE: TAKE THE BUILDING BLOCKS
OF A MOVIE YOU DISLIKE.
HOW D’YOU
REARRANGE THEM
INTO WHAT YOU DO LIKE?
#20.
YOU GOTTA IDENTIFY WITH YOUR
SITUATION/CHARACTERS,
CAN’T JUST WRITE ‘COOL’.
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU
ACT THAT WAY?
#21.
WHAT’S THE ESSENCE OF YOUR STORY?
MOST ECONOMICAL
TELLING OF IT?
IF YOU KNOW THAT, YOU CAN
BUILD OUT FROM THERE.
#22.
LIKE & SHARE
TO SHOW SOME
CARE.
THANK YOU.
