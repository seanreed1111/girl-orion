Name: Tyra or Stella?


--The Sun and Other Stars

-- A Star is Born
Every star has a secret life that’s mostly hidden from people on Earth.
Only the scientists who study stars know a lot about them. And now, so do I.
A girl and her magical star doll go on a magical journey to into space, to special places where new stars are born. 
Bell then takes Stella into the Orion Nebula, where they meet baby stars, and learn about the million year process through which stars are born.


S: I want to go see baby stars. I want to see how baby stars are born

B:We can go there, and you can see the ones that have just been born, but it’s really boring there lots of star dust and clouds of gas and it’s never that interesting
Nothing ever happens there

S:But if we go there, something WILL happen.
B: No it probably won’t.
S: Yes, Bella. Let’s go there. You’ll see. I am right!

She cried because she wouldnt be able to do her hw, to watch how the stars move.

This story is about a young girl who awakens at night and goes on an adventure to visit among the stars, some of whom come alive to speak to her about what they are made of and how they came to be.

-- The Girl Who Sees The Dance of Mintaka

-- The Girl Who Sees the Milky Way
Stella must see the broad track of the Milky Way, the center of our galaxy.

The Milky Way is a spiral, and we are spinning along near the edge.

While she saw how beautiful the Milky Way was, Tyra suddenly felt sing-y. 
This was a surprise, even to her. 
So this is what she sang.
Flecks of Extraterrestrial Dust, All Over the Roof!

Star dust can sometimes be found on earth if you know where to look.

According to NASA, cosmic dust particles are made of various elements, including carbon, oxygen, iron and others, all heavier than the hydrogen and helium believed to be the primordial substances of the universe.
Much of the dust is believed to be the product of supernovas, explosions of giant stars, like one visible from Earth in 1987. The dust clouds left by that explosion, designated SN 1987A, have been extensively studied.
Cosmic dust is found on Earth as well as in space, and particles have recently been identified not just in the relatively clean ice of polar regions but in ordinary dust on rooftops in Oslo, Norway.
In 2014, NASA announced that it had tentatively identified seven minute particles from the Stardust spacecraft, which returned to Earth in 2006, as contemporary interstellar space dust.
