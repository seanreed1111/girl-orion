MOMMY, WHAT’S THE WEATHER TOMORROW? 
IS IT CLOUDY AT NIGHT?

IT WILL BE CLOUDY ALL WEEK, BABY. I’m SORRY.

Tyra TALKS TO Bella and also HER PEOPLE here
She introduces Bella, arranges everything, and goes to sleep disappointed.



Bell and Stella look up at the sky as seen from Earth and pick out the constellation Orion.
Bell discusses the features of Orion, its most famous stars Betelgeuse and Bell, its belt, and the Orion Nebula where new stars are born. 
Stella asks if the stars are close to each other.

Bell says no, they only look close from our point of view on Earth, like you can take a picture of yourself pinching the Moon with your fingers even though you are nowhere near the Moon.

Bell and Stella go to Betelgeuse the Red Giant star. Stella learns about star colors and temperatures and the fact that stars are all different sizes even though they all look the same small size from Earth

Bell and Stella then go to Bell namesake star. It is a young blue giant, much younger than our Sun, and already halfway through its brilliant short life.

*A poem*
I know what I would rather be
If I always didn’t have to be me!
I would rather be a star,
A bright blue star,
A shiny spinning star,
Up in space for all to see.

    Bella wants to see her namesake. This is the most important thing to her
    Has she ever been to her namesake before? Yes. But she hasn’t been there for a long time


Greedy eyes.
There was wide wandering for the greediest eye,
To peer about on variety
the never-ending night.


Bella doesn’t want to gonsee Betelgeuse first, because she doesn’t think Tyra won’t like Bellatrix if she shes how amazing Betelgeuse is

Tyra took to shouting because she knew that sound had a hard time moving in space.
But Bellatrix just looked at her quizzically, and then finally asked the obvious quedtion WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING AT ME?
Because I thought I should, Tyra answered.
Well, you shouldn’t, replied Bella.

After a long Christmas day full of presents and food and family Tyra took her new doll upstairs and got ready for bed. 
She arranged her people on the bed the way she liked them, so they could all look out the window.
 But there was one more thing to do.

she arranged her people on the bed to make sure they could all see. 
She opened her window to make sure there was a clear view from her bed. 
And opened her curtain but discovered the clouds overhead. SHE COULDN’T SEE THE STARS. 
The thing she’d been thinking about all day, looking up at the stars with her new STAR DOLL, was not possible now. 
It would have to wait under tomorrow, or whatever day the clouds cleared. 



What does our planet look like from space? Most are familiar with beloved images of the blue marble or pale blue dot — Earth from 18,000 and 3.7 billion miles away, respectively. But closer to home, at the boundary between Earth and space, you might encounter an unfamiliar sight. If you were to peer down on Earth from just 300 miles above the surface, near the orbit of the International Space Station, you could see vibrant swaths of red and green or purple and yellow light emanating from the upper atmosphere.

This light is airglow.

Airglow carries information on the upper atmosphere’s temperature, density, and composition, but it also helps us trace how particles move through the region itself: https://go.nasa.gov/2q1dQ8S

Bella to the rescue!!!!!!!!
Bella has got to tell jokes right away.
As soon as she comes to life. Establish character early and try to keep the star jokes coming throughout the story

ALL ABOARD!
Well, are you coming?
Where?
To Orion, of course.

Stars don’t have skin but they do shed pieces of themselves out into space. Fast moving particles that move in big groups together just like the wind. So we call it the stellar wind.






When I was seven I got a magical doll for Christmas.
Her name is Bell. It is short for Bellatrix, that’s her real name, but nobody ever calls her that.
Bell is named after a giant blue star in the constellation Orion.
That’s Bellatrix right there. [points on star map]
Bell is not nearly as big as the star she’s named after, but she is blue, and she looks like a star.
Not the kinds of stars you see with the five pointy ends. Real stars are great big round spinning fireballs in the sky.
So that’s why Bell is round.

When they got her for me my mom and dad didn’t know she was magical. They still don’t. I didn’t even find out myself until after bedtime on Christmas Day.


STELLA WANTS TO SEE Betelgeuse FIRST. SHE KNOWS IT IS RED. CAN SEE IT IS RED FROM EARTH. BUT BELLA WANTS TO SEE RIGEL AND THE BLUE STARS FIRST, FOR HER OWN REASONS.


-- RIGEL
    Although appearing as a single star to the naked eye, Rigel is a multiple star system composed of at least four stars. The name Rigel strictly refers to only the primary star (A), although it is commonly applied to the whole system. 

    The traditional name Rigel is derived from Arabic, meaning leg or foot[20]; the star represents the foot of Orion. Rigel is a blue supergiant 
    Rigel is a prominent equatorial navigation star, being easily located and readily visible in all the world's oceans (the exception is the area within 8° of the North Pole).

    

    The primary has a companion star 9.5″ away with an apparent magnitude of 6.7, 400 times fainter than the primary. The companion, often referred to as Rigel B or Rigel BC, is actually a triple star system. Two stars, components B and C, can be resolved by very large telescopes. The brighter of the two is a spectroscopic binary, the components designated Ba and Bb. A fainter star separated from the others by nearly an arc-minute, may also form part of the same star system. Component B is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, which shows two sets of spectral lines combined within its single stellar spectrum. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86 days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, likely form a physical triple star system,[62] although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.[7]

     At Rigel's estimated distance, Rigel B's projected separation from its primary is over 2,200 AU. Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share similar common proper motion.[55][62] The pair would have a minimum orbital period of around 18,000 years.

    Rigel's pulsation properties suggest it may have already passed through a red supergiant phase and then increased its temperature to become a blue supergiant for a second time, something that is expected for some sufficiently massive stars.

    Rigel is currently a massive blue supergiant calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times as luminous as the Sun, depending on the method used to calculate its properties and assumptions about its distance, estimated to be about 860 light-years (260 pc). Rigel's radius is over 70 times that of the Sun, and its surface temperature is 12,100 K. Pulsations cause Rigel's small intrinsic brightness variations, and it is classified as an Alpha Cygni variable.

    Rigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a Type II supernova.[11] It is one of the closest known potential supernova progenitors to Earth,[16] and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around −11 (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets.)


-- Betelgeuse belches out a blast of matter. Coronal mass ejections. And doesn't even say excuse me. More jokes from Stella. Bella laughs.
Bell loves to be in outer space. 
Stella was in a hurry to go to the stars and in a hurry to come back home. Just like my kids at the beginning and the end of Spring Break.
Young kids cry both at the beginning and the end of trips because they loe routine and they hate change.

-- Stella tired at the end of her long night's journey. She doesn't WANT to go to sleep, she just can't help it. Exhausted from travelling over hundreds of light years in one night. 



------------------------------- 
The Girl Who Went to Orion - Summary
-- A girl and her new doll embark on a fantastic journey to visit the stars in the constellation Orion.


*The Story*
-- Stella gets a new doll from her dad before she goes to bed. A blue star-shaped doll named Bell, short for Bellatrix. Stella is fascinated with Orion so it is the perfect gift. 
-- Stella and her new friend go to the window together to look up at the constellation Orion in the sky. She really wants to go to space to see it.
-- Stella puts Bell in the place of honor on her bed with all of her other people. She makes Bell comfortable and then goes to sleep with Bell right beside her.
-- While Stella is sleeping, Bell starts to glow brightly, a pale blue light like her color. Then Bell begins to hum. The humming finally wakes Stella up
-- Hullo, Stella, says Bell.
    
    Stella thought over what she should do next. She thought it extremely odd that Bell spoke to her, Bell being a doll and all that. But she also thought it would be extremely rude not to say hello back after someone's already said hello to you first!
    So she said 'Hello Bella'. 

    Thinking about it made her calm and as they spoke more, it seemed less and less to her that it was such a big deal that Bella could talk. 

-- So, said Bella, you want to go to visit Orion?
    Yes! It's so pretty from my window. I want to see what it looks like close up. It's even better, I bet.
    Bella smiled. It is, she said.
    So, said Bella, have you thought about WHEN you want to go to Orion?
    I'm not an astronaut, I can't go to outer space!
    Bella said nothing. Just looked around the Stella's room and all the star stuff Stella had collected over her very short nine years.
    Stella just stared at Bella for a long time. And then she understood.
    _You_ can take me to outer space? Really? But how?
    How is a really good question. But _when_ is a better one?
    When? How about NOW?
    Bell reached out her hand towards Stella. Stella looked at it, and her brain was a jumble. She thought about rockets blasting off, and astronauts in heavy suits floating about in space, and she thought about all the satelites orbiting Earth and being out in space and watching them whiz by from close up. And she thought about looking back at Earth and watching it get smaller and smaller until it disappeared. And she couldn't have stopped herself from smiling if she'd tried, so she didn't even try. She took hold of Bell's hand, smiling like she'd not smiled in many days. The two of them floated towards the window, and then through it, out into the nighttime sky.

    wondering why star dolls had hands at all. She couldn't help herself. 

-- Bell looks down on her town from high in the sky. She's excited and scared.
-- Bell looks back and sees the curve of the Earth, the big blue marble, and the terminator. She wanted to see everything. Everywhere she looked there was something to see. Maybe if she had enough eyes she could do that, she could see evrything she wanted, but not with just two.
    There is a shimmering around her and Bell now, a sparkly envelope covering both of them. 
    S: Space is cold. And there's no air. How come I'm not cold? And, you know, breathing and stuff. Stella feels the nervous energy rise up from her stomach to her throat.
    S: I knew you meant now, but not now now, you know? We went so fast! You didn't give me enough time to get ready. Space is cold, I don't have my robe or my house shoes, I don't want my feet to be cold. Can we go please go back and get my robe? 
    S: It’s Thursday, isn’t it? I never could get the hang of Thursdays.
    "I should go get my robe. And socks! I’m going to need some warm socks so can we go back, because my feet get really ...
    B: Tell me a joke.
    S:what?!
    B:Don’t you know any jokes?
    S:Well, sure, I know some, but..
    B: So tell me one! I really want to hear you tell a joke. Do you know any good ones?
    The question of thinking of a joke took Stella by surprise. Bell really looked like she was waiting for Stella’s absolute BEST joke, so Stella0 did not want to disappoint her. While she was thinking about jokes than Bella might like, she totally forgot to be scared anymore.


    Do you know any jokes?, said Bell.
    This took Stella by surprise. 
-- Bell asked, What is a constellation? 
    Stella replied, A constellation is when people play connect-the-dots with the stars in the sky and make them into a person or an animal or a thing they like. My teacher told me most of the stars and constellations are named after boys or animals.
    Constellations as seen from Earth versus constellations as they really are in three dimensions. 
    Only stars that are brighter or closer to Earth are in constellations, because then more people could see them when they looked up at night. The stars became famous because they were close and bright. 
-- Bell names the stars in Orion. The corners are Betelgeuse and Bellatrix, Rigel and Saiph. The Belt stars are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka.

-- Stella want to visit Betelgeuse first.
    If you visit Betelgeuse first, you won't really understand how very odd it is. Trust me, we should visit Rigel first if you want to see Rigel.
    
-- I want to see Orion's Belt next. What are the names of the stars on the belt?
-- Now can we see Betelgeuse?
-- Bella: While we are here, there's one more star that I want you to see.
    Stella: I'm really tired Bell. Is it a special star? Is it big, is it blue, is it spinning fast or slow.
    Bella: Well, it's not really that special. It's blue like Rigel and the ones in the belt, but not as big. 
    Stella: Oh can we see it later, then? I am so tired.
    Bella: softly I kind of like it though. Maybe you will, too. Since we're here now we might as well go, don't you think.
    Stella: Ok, I guess. Since we are here. (Stella missed the cue)
-- (At Bellatrix the star) Here it is, Stella. Isn't it pretty?
    Yes, very. It looks like Alnitak, and Alnilam, and Mintaka. I can't remember which one is which now.
    Bella: You can't even tell it from the other ones? Don't you think it looks special?? I think it is better that all the stars in Orion. Better than those, even better than Rigel and Betelgeuse.
    Stella: If you say so.
    Bella: sulks, silent.
    Stella It's this star here, right? What is its name? The name is not on my map. What's the name of this star?
    Bella: I forget. (sulks)
    Stella. I KNOW you didn't forget.
    Did too!
    Did not.
    S: Bella, just TELL me, already. I want to write it down on my map so I don't forget.
    B: Fine. It's Bellatrix. This star is Bellatrix. My name is from this star. Her name is my name. We have the same name.



-- Stella shows all her people where she was that night. They all camp out at the window looking in the night sky. Show knows she will go out there again with Bell one day soon.
