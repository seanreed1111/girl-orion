-- BEGINNING

S: The first thing Bell ever said to me was this. 
"Hullo, Stella. I sang a long time before you finally woke up."

You know what's funny? I remember hearing someone humming, the sound of the Bell signing came into whatever dream I was having then! The song was "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star". I don't remember what I did with the song in my dream but I remember that I rolled over and looked at Bell, and BELL WAS THE ONE WHO WAS HUMMING.

I rolled over, and looked at her, and that's when she said "Hullo, Stella."


Now, I probably should have asked her a lot of questions right then, like "How come you can talk?" and other stuff like that. But it just didn't occur to me at the time.  I did figure I should say SOMETHING so as to not be rude. 
I didn't know what you were *supposed* to say when dolls start talking to you, so all I could think of to say was "Hi, Bella"


There are a few famous stars in Orion, one called Betelgeuse, and one called Rigel, and maybe we can see one of the other ones if we have time.
As we got further away from Earth
I was so busy looking where we were going that I forgot to look back to where we CAME from.

By the time I looked back I could see our Sun as a yellowish dot in the sky, no bigger than all the other stars around it. And I couldn't make out the Earth at all until Rigel showed me where it was.

I clutched Bell tightly. I remember pretending to not be afraid. I was in outer space! So I expected to be cold, and I expected to not be able to breath because there's no air in space. But I was fine, and wasn't the least bit cold, and I was breathing normally. (show the faint field shimmering around both of them)


I should go get my robe. And socks! I’m going to need some warm socks so can we go back, because my feet get really ...
Tell me a joke.
what?!
Don’t you know any jokes?
Well, sure, I know some, but..
So tell me one! I really want to hear you tell a joke. Do you know any funny ones?
The question of thinking of a joke took Stella by surprise. Bell really looked like she was waiting for Stella’s absolute BEST joke, so Stella0 did not want to disappoint her. While she was thinking about jokes than Bella might like, she totally forgot to be scared anymore.


B: Do you know what stars are? I mean, what they are made of, and what they look like up close?
No one had ever asked me that before. I never thought about them as REAL THINGS, THEY were just little lights high up in the sky.
They all looked mostly the same, except some were brighter and some were dimmer. But they aren't the same at all. They have different colors and different sizes. Some are super hot, even hotter than our Sun. And some are colder. Also, they spin! Just like the Earth spins, just like our Sun spins.

Bella got brighter the closer they got to her namesake star. Just a little bit brighter, and just a little bit bluer. She was absolutely beaming by the time they arrived close to the giant blue star.

-- ENDING

I went to sleep somewhere on the long trip home.
Bell told me she tried to wake me when we were passing near the Sun but I didn’t budge. That ended up being ok because Bell and I went to see the Sun another night not long after.
She said we just kept going straight back to Earth from there, and she took me right down to my town and through my windows and right back into my bed. I wasn’t awake for any of that, either. I just woke up the next morning with Bell at my side, and I knew it was all real.

The next night when the stars came out I was looking out of my window, waiting for them. I saw Bellatrix and Betegeuse and Bell helped me learned the names of all the other stars in Orion, too. I forgot all about not getting to see the Sun. Anyway, Bell and I ended up going there a lot since it was so close.
I just remembered what I did see, and the fun we had together, and even though I can point out lots of stars to people now, Bell’s star will always be my favorite.

I wanted to take something back with me as a souvenir of my trip. We couldn't get close enough to touch ANYTHING, and I dn't even know there would have been anything to touch, just heat and light and warmth, like our Sun pressing on my face, all the light presses down on you and you don't know how you can feel light, but you do. I did. I still do. I remember how it feels. If I stand quiet and try really hard I still feel it. So I guess I brought something how from my trip after all.
