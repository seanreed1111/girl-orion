-- INT Stella's bedroom - NIGHT
    Stella brings Bella back to her people

-- INT Stella's bedroom - NIGHT
    Stella and Bella talk before going out of the window into space

-- EXT Outer Space (Near Earth View) - NIGHT
    Stella and Bella hurtle towards the stars as Earth looms large in the background. Stella scared at the suddeness of it all.

-- EXT Interstellar Space (FAR FROM EARTH) - NIGHT
    Stella and Bella continue in space. Earth is just one shiny dot in the background among many. ORION visible far ahead in the distance.
    Gas, dust, and nothingness. Stella knows stars are large, so Bella makes Stella the size of the SUN! Stella thinks this is big enough to tower over Rigel, but it is not.
    

-- EXT Outer Space -Orbiting Rigel - NIGHT
    bright blue supergiant Rigel 
        Mass = 21±3 M☉
        Radius = 78.9±7.4 R☉
        Luminosity = 120,000 L☉
    starspots on Rigel cooler and DARKER than the rest of the star. Like sunspots. A now Sun-sized Stella still dwarfed by blue supergiant Rigel. Rigel is a multi-star system.

-- EXT Outer Space NEAR Alnitak in Orion's Belt - NIGHT
        -- The stars of the Belt - Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka. Stars of the belt are also known as Three Kings or Three Sisters. Alnitak and Mintaka are multi-star systems. 
        -- Alnitak A is itself a close binary, comprising  of Alnitak Aa (a blue supergiant) 
            Mass = 33 ± 10 M☉
            Radius=20.0 ± 3.2 R☉
            Luminosity = 250,000 L☉

        -- Alnilam 
            Mass =40 M☉
            Radius = 32.4R☉
            Luminosity = 537,000 L☉
            is a large blue supergiant star some 2,000 light-years distant in the constellation of Orion. It is estimated to be 275,000 to 832,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and 30–64.5 times as massive.

        -- Stella begins argument to be bigger. 

-- EXT Interstellar Space (Leaving Orion's Belt) - NIGHT
    Stella continues argument to be bigger. so Bella makes Stella the size of RIGEL! Rigel-sized Stella is happy bigger than the stars of the belt she has seen. She feels more comfortable in the vastness of space.
    But it is still not big enough.

-- EXT Outer Space NEAR Betelgeuse - NIGHT
        Red supergiant Betelgeuse 
            Mass = 11.6 +-[11] M☉
            Radius = 887 ± 203, 
            Radius = 955±217 R☉
            Luminosity  90,000 – 150,000 L☉)

    Stella dwarfed by Betelgeuse. Nothing is big enough compared to red supergiant. 
        -- Vast plume of gas and stardust ejected from Betelgeuse into the surrounding atmosphere. Length as large as 30AU, our whole solar system.
        -- hotspots on Betelgeuse, areas hotter and BRIGHTER than the rest of the star
        -- Betelgeuse belches.
        -- How many Suns can fit inside Betelgeuse?

-- EXT Outer Space NEAR Bellatrix - NIGHT
        Bella makes Stella Normal size again as they approach Bellatrix.
        Bella wants Stella at normal size to see her namesake in perspective. It is regular sized when compared to the Blue and Red supergiants they've seen. The Belt stars are also regular. 

-- EXT Outer Space NEAR Bellatrix - NIGHT
            -- Namesake. Bella is home. 
            -- Stella is exhausted and says she's not sleepy. 
            -- Bella takes her home

-- EXT Outer Space (Near Earth View) - NIGHT
    Stella and Bella hurtle back towards Earth

-- EXT Sky above Stella's neighborhood- NIGHT
    Stella and Bella can see Stella's bedroom window in the distance.

-- INT Stella's Bedroom - NIGHT
    Bella puts Stella to bed.

-- INT Stella's Bedroom - THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
    Stella gathers around the window with all her people. She recounts her adventures with Bell to them, pointing in the directions of the stars of Orion out of her bedroom window.
