-- POV 
    STELLA enjoys reliving her childhood travels with Bella. JOY. Going back to the past to a good place. The stories of her childhood.

-- RESOLUTION
    Bellatrix becomes special to Stella BECAUSE it is special to Bella. When Stella learns it is Bell's namesake, she loves it just as much as she loves Bella.


Stella didn't KNOW that Bell could REALLY BRING HER INTO OUTER SPACE JUST LIKE THAT. Regrets her decision, initially. Surprised, and SCARED. 
But she deals with it.


Tyra liked to be 100% sure of her answers before she states them. Otherwise she will keep quiet. Even if mostly sure.

Bella wants to take Tyra tonsee beautiful things close up, but Tyra is focused on the dangers and chooses to keep her distance.

Stella is VULNERABLE. She understands how dependent she is on Bella to get home. To not die. 
Stella is scared of being left alone by Bella out there in space. Which is something that Bella would never do. But they don't know each other that well yet, so Stella doesn't know this!

Stella is scared of the dark of outer space. So many DARK areas to pass through. 
Common kid fears are irrational. Kids cry and cling. Stella cries and clings to Bell at first. But hides it in her memory. Stella is a little bit unreliable as a narrator from that perspective. 

STELLA WANTS TO SEE Betelgeuse FIRST. SHE KNOWS IT IS RED. CAN SEE IT IS RED FROM EARTH. BUT BELLA WANTS TO SEE RIGEL AND THE BLUE STARS FIRST, FOR HER OWN REASONS.

OMG Stella GROWS AND SHRINKS TO STAR SIZE LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND. 
Perfect for showing the relative sizes of stars in an easy way. 
Even if she were as big as the sun, she would still be small next to Betelgeuse and Rigel.

One of the things that is important for friends is listening

Bella wasn’t being a good friend because she didnt listen to 
Stella’s fears at first. 
She was treating the trip like something she’s done lots of times. 
But it is Stella’s FIRST time. and she needed to feel more 
comfortable, to go slower.

    When Bella realizes this, she CHANGES. She becomes a friend, and helps Stella get over the fear, rather than ignoring Stella’s fears as unimportant.

    *That* is when Bella starts to tell jokes to make Stella laugh, to make her comfortable in this brand new environment of space.


Stella gets tired and they return back home. Stella gives Bell the prime space next to her on her bed, and they both go to sleep after their long adventure.
