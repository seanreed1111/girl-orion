Bellatrix and Betelgeuse
Rigel and Saiph
Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka

I am Bellatrix. Her name is my name.

Bellatrix
Tells jokes
used to getting her own way
likes to give tours, but likes them to go a certain way that she is used to and doesn’t like them to deviate
she doesn’t deal well with things she can’t control
she doesn’t really like people to disagree with her opinions. 
She thinks her opinions are always right.
Maybe they are and maybe they aren’t. It depends on whether other people want the same things as you do.

Bella has got to tell jokes right away.
As soon as she comes to life. Establish character early and try to keep the star jokes coming throughout the story

Bella is initially bossy in a way Tyra doesnt like. Bella likes getting her own way and Tyra doesnt like to be rushed.

Tyra liked to be 100% sure of her answers before she states them. Otherwise she will keep quiet. Even if mostly sure.

Bella wants to take Tyra tonsee beautiful things close up, but Tyra is focused on the dangers and chooses to keep her distance.

Bell glowed a little brighter as we got closer to her namesake. Just a little bit brighter, and just a little bit blueer.

-- CONFLICT
    STELLA WANTS TO SEE Betelgeuse FIRST. SHE KNOWS IT IS RED. CAN SEE IT IS RED FROM EARTH. BUT BELLA WANTS TO SEE RIGEL AND THE BLUE STARS FIRST, FOR HER OWN REASONS. 

-- CONFLICT
    Bella does not tell Stella that one of the stars in Orion is her namesake. She hides the info, in case Stella does not think her star is beautiful. 
-- DESIRELINE
    Bella wants Stella to love Bellatrix as much as Bella does. 
    Friendship through loving and sharing something that you love deeply.
    Bella is scared of the possibility of rejection of something she loves so strongly

    Bellatrix becomes special to Stella BECAUSE it is special to Bella.

OMG Stella GROWS AND SHRINKS TO STAR SIZE LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND. 
Perfect for showing the relative sizes of stars in an easy way. 
Even if she were as big as the sun, she would still be small next to Betelgeuse and Rigel.

One of the things that is important for friends is listening

Bella wasn’t being a good friend because she didnt listen to 
Stella’s fears at first. 
She was treating the trip like something she’s done lots of times. 
But it is Stella’s FIRST time. and she needed to feel more 
comfortable, to go slower.

    When Bella realizes this, she CHANGES. She becomes a friend, and helps Stella get over the fear, rather than ignoring Stella’s fears as unimportant.

    *That* is when Bella starts to tell jokes to make Stella laugh, to make her comfortable in this brand new environment of space.


Stella gets tired and they return back home. Stella gives Bell the prime space next to her on her bed, and they both go to sleep after their long adventure.
