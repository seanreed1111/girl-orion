S: Can we be out here? Can I be out here? Space is cold. And there's no air to breathe.
B: Well, how do you feel? Right now.
S: Fine.
B: Breathing ok? 
S: Yes.
B: Cold?
S: No.

S: Yes she really is.
B: Blue is my favorite color.

-- Stars are snakes. 
They don’t have skin but they do shed pieces of themselves out into space. 
Fast moving particles that move in big groups together just like the wind. 
So we call it the stellar wind.

-- Stars make sounds. They rattle and hum. 

-- Stars are alive. The surface is constantly moving and changing, seething. Remarkable to watch. 

--Stars are like volcanoes.
They explode and spew their insides out for everyone to see.

--Stars spin! Just like the Earth. And the Sun.

--With Betelgeuse in the place of our Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter would all be *inside* of it. 

--Betelgeuse spins sloowly. It takes about eight EARTH YEARS to go around once. Our Sun spins once every 20 hours.

-- It’s Thursday, isn’t it? I never could get the hang of Thursdays.

S: I didn't know that stars have different colors!

B:How the close the stars look from Earth is different than how far away they really are from each other.

B: People have looked up at the stars in the sky as long as people have been around. 
Sometimes they would see patterns of bright stars and imagine they saw the shape of people or animals in the night sky.
We call these groups of stars constellations.

Constellations are connect-the-dot pictures that ancient people traced out on the stars in the nighttime sky

S: Why does Betelgeuse look like that?, I asked. I'd expected it to be perfectly round like the other stars I'd seen. 

The Old Man and the Sea (1952), novel by Ernest Hemingway. The Old Man Santiago sees Rigel at sunset off the coast of Cuba: "It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September ... The first stars were out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends."
